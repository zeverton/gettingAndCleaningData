Run_Analysis.R file README
Created by Z.Everton Jan.24.2015

This script will pull the specific file used in the week 3 project assigned as part of the getting and cleaning data course on Coursera.
After pulling the data the code process the data and reformats and summarizes the data in a way that it can be deemed "clean" or "tidy".

This is not a function, it is just a script, meaning you do not source it. 

To run the script follow these steps:
1. Open RStudio and ensure your working directory is set to a folder where the proper inputs are being housed in the "UCI HAR Dataset" folder
2. Open the Run_analysis.R file in RStudio
3. Highlight the entire script
4. click "Run" at the top of the script window.

The output has 4 columns of data:
1. Activity (ie Laying, Walking, etc.)
2. Subject (designated by number)
3. VariableDescription (description of the particular data collected and represented in the table)
4. meanOfValues (summarized data ouputted by the run_analysis script)
